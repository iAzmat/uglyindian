## [Ugly Indian Hackathon Submission](https://github.com/indiarising/hackathon/blob/master/README.md) 

### Our Concept:

**Login Screen** 
Should have Facebook log into facilitate sharing to create awareness. We could also have anon accounts with limited actions. Signups are not in scope although possible for future releases. 
When a person logs in they will be assigned a random identity icon and a username. This is inline with the Ugly Indian’s current role of not using the activity to promote individuals but rather the movement.

**Maps Dashboard**
When a person logs in, this is the default dashboard that he would see. We will take their location data to allow us to narrow it down to his place of interest.
An ugly spot is identified using a ‘Marker’. More markers means that the map can get ‘uglier'.

+ Map Actions: Ability to pan/zoom/filter your location.

+ Marker Actions: Touching a Marker will give us a toolip card with actions to view the location/event page. The card will have info like address, people attending, date of event, fund/item raising status, health of the location (incase spotfix has happened)

**Create a Post** We will ask the user to add 3 most important features of the spotfix; the location, a picture and a date for spotfix(optional). This is enough to create the page.
The creator is then shown the profile page where he could do the other actions like Share/Invite people to it, Describe and Comment on the plan, Add more Photos.
The spot fix is given an automated title upon generation and this can be edited if necessary. The page has functions which allow edit details and perform operations like Join, Leave and Delete. Archival actions are also planned to be present.

**User Management** We will have 2 kinds of User Levels to begin; admin and contributor. The admin can be of two kinds; system level and event level. 
A system level admin status can be given to a dedicated team of people who can moderate the whole site. A person who creates the spot fix will be its (event level) admin.
Each user will have a profile card with minimum details. There is a possibility to apply gamification to the activities. As of now we have planned achievement badges for completion of spot fixes. These are in turn used to judge the trust level of a user. 

**Contribute** This feature will allows user to broadcast a ‘need’ for the spot fix. For eg., if they require more people to help out or to get cleaning equipment.
A broadcast could be sent to the nearby users. On the contribute page, the requests are displayed and can be contributed to.

**Prototype**
Given the available time, we decided to focus on utilising our strengths to build the application which is why we are currently working on it as a web application.
The application is live at [http://ugly-indian.geekd.in/](http://ugly-indian.geekd.in/)
